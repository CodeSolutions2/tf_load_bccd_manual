# tf_load_bccd_manual

A modified copy of the BCCD Tensorflow dataset (https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/bccd) of blood cell images to demonstrate competency in performing image classification on medical data. 

The dataset could not be accessed using the Tensorflow datasets library (ie: tfds.load('bccd')), thus a direct download was performed following the instructions at https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/bccd. The following Kaggle notebook outlines how the modified dataset was created and used for image classification:
